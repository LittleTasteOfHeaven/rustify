## About
Some common algorithms implemented in rust.

Nothing special, my end goal is to have a simple understanding why rust exists. Writing little programs to see how it is benefitting me with its claimed memory-safety features.

Most algorithms are ported to [crates.io](https://crates.io). as library crates. :)

## Backers
The folks over Jetbrains :) I will recommend their products, they are elegant and awesome.
