# rusty-algo
Some common algorithms implemented in rust.

Nothing special, my end goal is to have a simple understanding why rust exists. Writing little programs to see how it is benefitting me with its claimed memory-safety features.

Thats it :) Some code was turned into zombie crates and thrown over to [crates.io](https://crates.io).
